# Merged Video Player with Video.js

This project demonstrates a simple webpage with a Video.js player that plays two videos consecutively and loops back to the first one when finished. The layout is centered and includes an aesthetically pleasing heading.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/merged-video-player.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory:**
   ```bash
   cd merged-video-player
   ```

3. **Open `index.html` in a Web Browser:**
   Double-click on the `index.html` file to open it in your default web browser.

## Usage

- The webpage displays a Video.js player with two video files (`video1.mp4` and `video2.mp4`) playing consecutively.
- When the first video ends, the player automatically switches to the second video.
- If the second video ends, it loops back to the first video, creating a continuous loop.

## Customization

- Add or replace video files in the same directory as the HTML file.
- Customize the appearance by modifying the styles in the `<style>` section of the HTML file.
